# web-dash

Web-Dash is a small Web UI for keeping an eye on your linux system, most likely your NAS or any Pi's/SBC's you have
Its aim is to provide information on statistics such as running services, memory usage, cpu usage and being able to control/toggle said services
Web-Dash will also have support for links to other web programs running so it can be used to navigate through your system remotely without having to bookmark a bunch of URL's
