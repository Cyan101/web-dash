# TODO

* Add program links (sonarr, radarr, transmission/deluge/rtorrent, plex)
* Use JS to poll and update cpu/mem usage
* add toggle for JS updating the page
* Show stats and bars for connected devices
* Add a way (launcher file?) to insert itself as a service to avoid relying on other systems like PM2
