# TODO

* Add program links (sonarr, radarr, transmission/deluge/rtorrent, plex) with a config in-case default links are changed
* Use JS to poll and update cpu/mem usage and a toggle for JS updating the page
* Show stats and bars for connected devices
* Add a way (launcher file?) to insert itself as a service to avoid relying on other systems like PM2
* Title for HTML as well as a config for the background
